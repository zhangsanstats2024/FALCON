Lagrangian version for cardinality-constrained problem:
1. Local Search (CDPSI) 
2. Solution path with maxSuppSize
3. Polish with IHT

<!---
Initialize with dense solution
Extra box constraint/L2 penalty to control the closeness to original weights

Cardinality-constrained problem:
1. implement Beck & Eldar
2. any other heuristic?
